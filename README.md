Hi! I am Dhrsaj Kaushal, a researcher and member of IEEE, currently affiliated with the School of Engineering at Ajeenkya D Y Patil University, Pune, India. My academic and research pursuits are primarily focused on sustainability, environmental science, and the application of advanced analytical techniques to solve real-world problems.

Overview
This repository contains the research and analysis conducted for understanding and mitigating the carbon footprint of food products. The study employs advanced analytical techniques to assess the carbon emissions across the entire food supply chain, including production, processing, transportation, and consumption phases. It aims to identify key contributors to greenhouse gas emissions and propose effective mitigation strategies. The project also includes advanced visualization techniques to present complex data in an intuitive manner and imputation methods to handle incomplete data.

Research Goals
Identify High Impact Foods: Determine which types of food have a more negative impact on the environment.
Stage-wise Emission Analysis: Understand which stage of food production contributes more to greenhouse gas emissions.
Plant vs Animal-Based Foods: Compare the carbon footprint of plant-based and animal-based foods.

Future Implications
The study provides valuable insights for enhancing resource efficiency, reducing emissions, and promoting sustainable agricultural practices. It also has significant implications for policy development, business practices, and consumer behavior.
